defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaReorganizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Publishing's plan source for core's media reorganizer
  (`mix phoenix_kit.media.reorganize`), registered through
  `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.media_reorganizer/0`.

  The group folders of `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaFolders` are
  planned by core's `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Reorganizer.ResourceSource`,
  which applies the whole `Reorganizer.Source` contract: when the host's
  hooks change, a group's folder moves under the new parent (a folder
  found by its deterministic `publishing-group-<uuid>` name is renamed
  after the name hook and its group's pointer back-filled); with no hook
  configured, nothing but reports.

  Orphans — folders of a trashed or deleted group, reported, never moved:
  core's scan finds them by the deterministic name only, and only at the
  root or under a parent a hook named for a live group. Every live folder of
  the site's Media library that a trashed group points at is therefore
  reported here too, through the pointer — whatever it is called and
  wherever it sits — once per folder, unless a live group points at it as
  well (it is that group's) or core's scan already reported it. A folder in
  another library is not the group's and is never reported. A hard-deleted
  group's pointer went with the row: its folder is reported only if core's
  scan finds it.

  Post folders (`MediaFolders.post_folders?/0`) are never planned: they sit
  inside their group's folder and move with it. A trashed post's folder is
  reported the same way, through the pointer its versions hold (a folder a
  live post points at too is not); a hard-deleted post's is not traced.

  What is publishing's own: a group is live until trashed, its pointer is
  `data["media_folder_uuid"]`, those pointer-found orphans, a
  `:hook_error` report for a name hook that cannot be called (core reports
  the parent hook only, and asks the name hook only once a folder exists),
  and `:unfiled` — a group or post whose files are still outside its folder,
  for which `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaAdoption` (`mix
  phoenix_kit_publishing.media.adopt --apply`) is the fix. The reorganizer
  moves folders only; it never files a file.
