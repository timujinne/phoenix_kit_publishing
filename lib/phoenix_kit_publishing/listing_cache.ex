defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.ListingCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Caches publishing group listing metadata in :persistent_term for sub-millisecond reads.

  Instead of querying the database on every request, the listing page reads from
  an in-memory cache populated from the database.

  ## How It Works

  1. When a post is created/updated/published, `regenerate/2` is called
  2. This queries the database and stores post metadata in :persistent_term
  3. `render_group_listing` reads from the in-memory cache
  4. Cache includes: title, slug, date, status, languages, versions (no content)

  ## Performance

  - Cache miss: ~20ms (DB query + store in :persistent_term)
  - Cache hit: ~0.1μs (direct memory access, no variance)

  ## Cache Invalidation

  Cache is regenerated when:
  - Post is created
  - Post is updated (metadata or content)
  - Post status changes (draft/published/archived)
  - Translation is added
  - Version is created

  ## In-Memory Caching with :persistent_term

  For sub-millisecond performance, parsed cache data is stored in `:persistent_term`.

  - First read after restart: queries DB, stores in :persistent_term (~20ms)
  - Subsequent reads: direct memory access (~0.1μs, no variance)
  - On regenerate: updates :persistent_term from DB
  - On invalidate: clears :persistent_term entry (next read triggers regeneration)

  @doc """
  Regenerates the cache if no other process is already regenerating it.

  This prevents the "thundering herd" problem where multiple concurrent requests
  all trigger cache regeneration simultaneously after a server restart.

  Uses ETS with `insert_new/2` for atomic lock acquisition - only one process
  can acquire the lock at a time. The lock includes a timestamp and will be
  considered stale after #{@lock_timeout_ms}ms to prevent permanent lockout
  if a process dies mid-regeneration.

  Returns:
  - `:ok` if regeneration was performed successfully
  - `:already_in_progress` if another process is currently regenerating
  - `{:error, reason}` if regeneration failed

  ## Usage

  On cache miss in read paths, use this instead of `regenerate/2`:

        :ok -> # Cache is ready, read from it
        :already_in_progress -> # Another process is regenerating, try again later
        {:error, _} -> # Regeneration failed, query DB directly
      end

  Accepts the same options as `regenerate/2` (notably `broadcast: false` for
  callers reacting to a `:cache_changed`).
