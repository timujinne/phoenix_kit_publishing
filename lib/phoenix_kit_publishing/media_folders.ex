defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaFolders do
  @moduledoc """
  One media folder per publishing group — and, optionally, one per post
  inside it — on core's per-record folder convention
  (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.ResourceFolders`).

  ## Opt-in

  Nothing happens until the host configures the parent hook: no folder is
  created and a picked file stays where it is. The module ships a
  ready-made pair — a `Publishing` folder at the root, one folder per
  group inside it, named after the group:

      config :phoenix_kit_publishing,
        attachments_parent_folder: {PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaFolders, :module_folder},
        attachments_folder_name: {PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaFolders, :folder_name}

  Either key can name the host's own function instead. The parent hook is
  called as `fun(:group, actor_uuid, group)` (or `fun(:group, actor_uuid)`)
  and answers `{:ok, folder_uuid}`, or `nil` for the media root; the name
  hook as `fun(subject, actor_uuid)` — a `%PublishingGroup{}`, or with post
  folders a `%PublishingPost{}` — answering `{:ok, name}`, or `nil` for the
  deterministic `publishing-group-<uuid>` / `publishing-post-<uuid>`.

  ## Post folders

  A second key puts each post's files in a folder of its own inside its
  group's, `Publishing/<group>/<post>`:

      config :phoenix_kit_publishing, :post_media_folders, true

  The ready-made name hook calls a post's folder after its slug (a
  timestamp post: its date and time). Without the key nothing about posts
  changes. A post folder's parent is always its group's folder, never a
  hook's answer.

  ## Pointers

  A group keeps its folder's uuid in `data["media_folder_uuid"]`; a post,
  which has no JSONB column of its own, in `data["media_folder_uuid"]` on
  each of its versions (a new version copies it); the ready-made parent
  hook keeps the module folder's in the `publishing_media_folder_uuid`
  setting — so a folder renamed or moved in the media browser, and a post
  or group renamed later, keep the folder they have. No migration.

  ## Filing

  `file_for_group/3` and `file_for_post/4` put files into a folder by
  core's attach rule: a file with no home is adopted, a file homed
  elsewhere is linked (it keeps its home), a file already there is left
  alone — and, for a post folder, a file homed in its group's own folder
  moves down into it. The editor calls `file_for_post/4` for every file
  chosen in the media picker; files that predate the configuration are
  filed by `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaAdoption`. Moving a group
  folder after the host changes its hooks is the core media reorganizer's
  job (`PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.MediaReorganizer`); post folders
  travel with their group's.
