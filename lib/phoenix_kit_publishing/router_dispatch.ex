defmodule PhoenixKitPublishing.RouterDispatch do
  @moduledoc """
  Routing strategy that lets publishing's catch-all coexist with host
  routes shaped `/:locale/something/...` declared after `phoenix_kit_routes()`.

  ## Why this exists

  Publishing's public URLs are dynamic — `/:language/:group/*path` where
  `:group` is any DB row. Phoenix.Router has no per-segment regex
  constraint, so the catch-all matches every two-or-more-segment URL.
  Phoenix matches in declaration order with no fall-through, which means
  any host route declared after `phoenix_kit_routes()` and shaped
  `/:locale/<literal>/...` is silently shadowed: publishing's controller
  matches first, doesn't find the group, returns 404.

  ## How this works

  Instead of registering the catch-all directly under `/`, publishing
  registers it under an internal prefix (`/__phoenix_kit_publishing_dispatch`).
  The host router's `call/2` is overridden (via Phoenix.Router's documented
  `defoverridable init: 1, call: 2`) to:

    1. Check if the request's first non-locale path segment is a known
       publishing group via `maybe_rewrite/1`.
    2. If yes — rewrite `conn.path_info` and `conn.request_path` to
       prepend the internal prefix; `super(conn, opts)` then matches the
       internal-prefix route and runs the full Phoenix pipeline normally.
    3. If no — pass through unchanged; Phoenix matches host routes.

  After the route matches, `restore_path/2` (a pipeline plug) un-mutates
  `request_path` and `path_info` so controllers reading `conn.request_path`
  for canonical URL generation see the URL the client sent, not the
  internal prefix.

  Phoenix's pipelines run via the internal-prefix scope's `pipe_through`,
  so `:browser` (sessions, CSRF, layout), `:phoenix_kit_*` (auth, locale),
  and any host-defined plugs are applied via the standard mechanism — no
  manual replication, no telemetry gap.

  ## Trade-offs

  * `mix phx.routes` shows the routes under the internal prefix. Devs
    debugging "where does `/blog/post` go?" need to know to look for
    `__phoenix_kit_publishing_dispatch`. Documented in core AGENTS.md.
  * Per-request cost: one DB lookup on each request. ETS/`:persistent_term`
    caching is a future optimization (the DB read is small + indexed).

  Decide whether `conn` is bound for publishing.

  Returns `{:rewrite, conn}` with `conn.path_info` and `conn.request_path`
  prepended with the internal prefix + a discriminator segment that
  picks publishing's localized vs non-localized route shape:

    * If `path_info[1]` is a known group → rewrite under
      `__phoenix_kit_publishing_dispatch/localized/...` so Phoenix matches
      `/:language/:group(/*path)` (the URL has a leading locale).
    * Else if `path_info[0]` is a known group → rewrite under
      `__phoenix_kit_publishing_dispatch/root/...` so Phoenix matches
      `/:group(/*path)` (no leading locale).

  Returns `:pass` if neither resolves to a known group. The dual
  discriminator is load-bearing — without it, both `/:language/:group`
  and `/:group/*path` would match a 2-segment internal path, and
  Phoenix's first-match-wins picks the localized form even when the
  URL had no locale prefix. That sends the request to the controller
  with `language=<group-slug>, group=<post-slug>` and the lookup fails.

  The DB lookup is small and indexed; a future optimization would
  cache the slug set in `:persistent_term`.
