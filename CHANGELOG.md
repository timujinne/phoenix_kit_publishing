# Changelog

## 0.4.7 - 2026-08-04

PR #38 — the public + admin language surfaces, sibling-dialect URLs, and a
concurrency-hardening pass — plus the post-merge review fixes. 0.4.6 was
tagged before this merge landed, so the whole wave ships here.

### Added
- **Sibling dialects of one base now have their own public URLs.**
  `LanguageHelpers.public_url_segment/1` gives a non-owner dialect its full
  lowercase code (`/en-gb/…`) while the base's owner dialect keeps the
  historical base segment (`/en/…`), so no existing URL changes. Routing,
  canonical redirects, the language switcher, feeds, and term archives all
  pin the segment through the same helper.
- **Cluster-wide listing-cache invalidation.** `ListingCache.CacheSync`, a
  supervised node-local subscriber, erases this node's `:persistent_term`
  listing entries when another node invalidates a group. `:persistent_term`
  is process-less, so a peer node's warm cache previously kept serving
  pre-mutation listings (rename/trash/delete, category changes) until an
  unrelated local mutation. Erase-only — the next read rebuilds lazily, so an
  invalidation can never start a cluster-wide regeneration storm.
- **Canonical-prefix 301s for feeds, search results, and term archives**,
  matching the plain listing. Feed redirects are strictly feed-to-feed.
- **Failure-side activity rows** for category create/update/delete/reorder,
  translation add/clear/delete, version create, and public comment create —
  every user-driven mutation now leaves a `db_pending` audit row when it
  fails. `ActivityLog.reason_string/1` keeps changesets (user free text) out
  of metadata.

### Changed
- **`delete_language/5` hard-deletes the content row** instead of setting
  `status: "archived"`. No read path ever filtered archived rows, so a
  "deleted" translation kept serving publicly, kept its `url_slug` claimed,
  stayed in `available_languages`, and `create_version_from` resurrected it
  as a draft in every new version. Versions remain the undo mechanism.
- **The primary language's content row can no longer be deleted** by
  `clear_translation/5` or `delete_language/5` — new
  `:cannot_delete_primary_language` error. It anchors publish validation, the
  post's `url_slug` identity, and the public primary URL. A legacy base-code
  row (`"en"` while primary is `"en-US"`) counts as primary; an enabled
  sibling (`"en-GB"`) does not.
- **Collaborative form keys are version-scoped** (`<group>:<uuid>:v<N>:<lang>`)
  and new-post keys are socket-scoped. Editors on v1 and v2 of the same
  language shared one lock/sync channel, and two admins composing new posts
  shared one lock.
- **Listing previews and feed item descriptions derive per-language.** The
  version-level `data["description"]` carries no language, so it showed one
  language's text under every language's title; it is now only the
  last-resort `og:description` default.
- **Presence metas carry `%{uuid, email}`, not the full `%User{}` struct**
  (`hashed_password` included — `redact:` only affects `Inspect`).
- Removed the unrouted all-groups overview template and the dead
  `dashboard_summary` assign, `build_summary/2`, and
  `PubSub.editor_presence_topic/1`.

### Fixed
- **StaleFixer could revert a concurrent publish.** The active-version
  pointer heal is now a compare-and-swap (`clear_active_version_if/2`) and
  the orphan demotion is conditional on the pointer still being NULL
  (`demote_version_if_orphaned/2`), with a fresh re-read between them.
- **Post saves take the post row lock** with an in-transaction version
  re-read, closing the save-vs-publish status TOCTOU and the lost updates
  parallel AI-translation jobs inflicted on `version.data` (tags and legacy
  promotions clobbering each other).
- **Group-settings saves take the group row lock** and re-merge against the
  fresh `data` — two concurrent saves used to read the same snapshot and the
  second silently reverted the first's setting keys.
- **Concurrent deletes could empty a version or a post.** Translation
  clear/delete and version delete now re-check "is this the last one" under
  the lock.
- **`name_i18n` merges per key.** The edit form only renders tabs for enabled
  languages, so a wholesale replace wiped the override of any language
  disabled after it was translated.
- **`:translation_deleted` now carries the version as a string**, matching
  `:translation_created` and the editor's `current_version` scope. An integer
  never compared equal, so the editor silently kept showing a language pill
  for a translation that no longer existed.
- **Sibling-language editors reload on shared version-field saves**, via a
  mirrored `:sibling_editor_saved` broadcast on the post's translations
  topic. Without it, a stale tab's next autosave reverted the sibling's
  categories and `published_at` (and so a timestamp post's public URL).
- **A never-edited V1 post no longer loses its featured image and
  description** on public surfaces — the mapper falls back to the legacy
  per-language `content.data` values until promotion-on-first-edit runs.
- **Untranslated stubs stop rendering as empty published pages.** "Add
  language" writes `{title: "Untitled", content: ""}` onto the active
  version, instantly public; those now read as a missing translation and go
  through the smart fallback, and they no longer produce Untitled listing
  cards.
- **A slug displaced by the collision self-healer joins
  `previous_url_slugs`**, so the established public URL 301s to the renamed
  one instead of being silently handed to the colliding post.
- **Date-count URL disambiguation is computed across all languages**
  (`Listing.group_date_counts/1`) — URL resolution is language-agnostic, so a
  language-filtered count emitted a date-only URL whose same-day sibling
  merely lacked the viewer's translation, resolving to a different post.
- **Public strings render in the right locale.** `Gettext.put_locale/2` is
  given the base code — catalogue directories are base-coded and gettext has
  no dialect fallback, so `"fr-FR"` matched nothing and every public string
  silently fell back to English. Comment-submission flashes set the locale
  too, and the notes section, `live` badge, and two admin page titles are now
  translatable.
- **Card excerpts are plain prose again**: PHK component markup is stripped
  before derivation (a truncated tag used to survive as escaped junk),
  `<style>`/`<script>` bodies are dropped rather than inlined as a wall of
  CSS, and HTML entities are decoded so `Fish & chips` stops reading
  `Fish &amp; chips`.
- **A malformed post UUID no longer crashes the LiveView** —
  `read_post_by_uuid/3` casts first and returns `{:error, :not_found}`.
  Crafted `switch_language` / `set_new_version_source` payloads and bare
  `/:group/edit` URLs are handled too.
- **PostShow live-updates again** (its `handle_info` head never matched the
  broadcast payload) and checks group membership, so one group's post can no
  longer render under another group's URL.
- **The admin dashboard stops multiplying its PubSub subscriptions.**
  `Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe/2` is not idempotent; every debounced refresh
  re-subscribed, delivering each post event N times.
- **AI source reads fail closed on a language mismatch** — the read falls
  back to another language when the requested row is missing, and translating
  that text labelled as the source language fanned wrong output out to every
  target.
- **The category `parent_uuid` FK is constrained in the changeset**, so a
  raced parent delete surfaces as a validation error rather than a 500.
- Editor and admin fixes: typing in the create-group custom-type box no
  longer wipes name/slug and flips the mode radio; a group-slug collision
  flashes instead of raising `CaseClauseError`; erasing a custom `url_slug`
  restores the default as the UI promises; publish failures name the real
  reason and unblock language/version switching; remote version deletion does
  a full editor transition (form, client content, URL); stuck translation
  locks self-release when Oban reports no active jobs; language pills open
  the version that actually holds the language; branching a version keeps the
  language pin and clearing a translation keeps the version pin.

## 0.4.6 - 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **The `leaf` requirement no longer locks hosts out of the release.** 0.4.5
  declared `{:leaf, "~> 0.4.1"}`, which was written meaning "0.4.1 or later" but
  reads as `>= 0.4.1 and < 0.5.0`. phoenix_kit core declares `~> 0.3`, so a host
  resolving both got leaf 0.5.1 — and with 0.5.x excluded here, the resolver
  quietly settled on publishing **0.4.4**, silently withholding the entire 0.4.5
  wave. `mix deps.update` could not break the tie; the only escape was pinning
  leaf back to 0.4.x in the host's `mix.exs`, i.e. downgrading the editor.

  The requirement is now `~> 0.4.1 or ~> 0.5`. The 0.4.1 floor still stands (it
  is where inline suggestions and `:flush` arrived); only the accidental ceiling
  is gone. leaf 0.5 removed nothing this package calls — its attr set is a strict
  superset of 0.4.1's, and the message contract only gained `{:leaf_flushed, …}`.

  Hosts loading leaf's JS the documented way
  (`import "../../../deps/leaf/priv/static/assets/leaf.js"`) move to the 0.5
  bundle automatically. A **CDN pin or a vendored copy of `leaf.js` must be
  updated by hand** — 0.5 is a server↔client contract change, and a bundle left
  behind fails silently. leaf 0.5.1 logs a console warning when it detects this.

## 0.4.5 - 2026-08-01

PR #37 — the publishing wave (Leaf editor, per-version categories,
gallery/notes/audio/comments, RSS feeds, search, view counts and a security
pass), plus the post-merge review fixes. 0.4.4 shipped before any of this
landed, so this release carries the whole wave.

### Added
- **Categories** — hierarchical, per-group taxonomy (`Publishing.Categories`,
  `PublishingCategory`), filed **per version** in `version.data["category_uuids"]`
  so a reader on `?v=2` sees how v2 was filed. Admin tree at
  `/admin/publishing/categories/:group` with drag reorder, "Move to…"
  re-parenting (cycle-checked under a row lock) and a typeahead picker in the post
  editor. Public archives at `/<group>/category/<slug>`, parent archives including
  their children. Legacy post-level rows are drained on first cache regeneration.
- **Body hashtags as the tag system** — writers type `#elixir` inline and the
  version's tags derive from the prose on save; the separate tags field is gone.
  Code regions, headings, URL fragments and Markdown links are excluded by
  construction. Public tag archives at `/<group>/tag/<tag>`.
- **RSS 2.0 feeds** per group and per category/tag archive
  (`/<group>/feed.xml`), gated by `publishing_feeds_enabled`, with podcast-style
  `<enclosure>` when a post carries an audio version.
- **Public listing search** (`?q=`, plain GET, no JS) behind the group's
  `search_enabled` setting.
- **View counts** (`Publishing.Views`) — per-day rollups, bot-filtered and
  session-deduped, no reader PII. `views_enabled` / `show_view_counts`.
- **Comments** — guarded seam to the optional `phoenix_kit_comments` package:
  dead-view thread, honeypot + signed time-trap form, per-note threads.
- **`<Showcase>`, `<Gallery>`, `<Audio>` and `<Note>` components** — an
  edge-bled image band, a CSS-only image helix (no JS; degrades to a plain grid),
  inline audio, and author notes in footnote or slide-out-panel style.
- **Leaf visual editor** replaces the old Markdown editor, with `preserve_tags`
  wired to `Renderer.component_tags/0` so a WYSIWYG round trip can't flatten a
  component.
- **New group settings** — `listing_layout`, `notes_style`, `show_prev_next`,
  `show_categories`, `search_enabled`, `views_enabled`, `show_view_counts`,
  `comments_enabled`.

### Fixed
- **Scheduled posts went public at the wrong hour.** `post_date`/`post_time` are
  stamped and displayed on the site's `time_zone` wall clock, but the new
  release check compared them against UTC — so on a site west of UTC an embargoed
  post appeared *early* by the offset (and late on a site east of it). The offset
  now has one owner (`Constants.site_offset_seconds/0`), shared by the stamping
  path so the two clocks cannot drift, and the release check runs on the site
  clock. Only sites left at the `"0"` default were unaffected.
- **RSS `pubDate` / `lastBuildDate` were off by the site's UTC offset** — same
  root cause; the site-local instant is now converted back to UTC before it is
  stamped `+0000`.
- **A category-tree query fired on every keystroke in the post editor** — the
  picker is a stateful LiveComponent, whose `update/2` runs on every parent
  render. It now reuses the tree it holds and re-reads on search (where
  freshness is load-bearing) or a group change.
- **`Hashtags.suggest/3` returned lowercase tags** while documenting that it
  keeps the group's own spelling; it now does, and folds both sides before
  matching so the change can't cost a match.
- **`mix test` failed without a database** — the new `dispatch_e2e_test.exs`
  missed the `:integration` tag every other DB-backed test inherits from its
  case template.
- Removed two unreachable branches (`Hashtags.tag_counts/1`'s `%{posts: …}`
  clause, `Categories.update_category/3`'s bare `:error`).

### Changed
- `show_tags` (per-group setting and `PublishingGroup.show_tags?/1`) is
  **removed** — tags live in the prose now and the post-page chip row is gone.
  Existing groups keep the key in their `data` JSONB, unread.
- New error atoms registered with `Publishing.Errors` (`:params_not_applied`,
  `:category_cycle`, `:parent_not_found`, `:parent_wrong_group`,
  `:invalid_order`) so they render as sentences rather than
  "Unexpected error: …".
- `mix credo --strict` and `mix dialyzer` are green again (29 findings across
  the wave: aliasing, nesting depth, four complexity hotspots, the
  `PhoenixKitComments` optional-seam dialyzer ignore, and a `MapSet` opacity
  violation in the category tree walk). Behaviour-preserving throughout.

Full review: `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/37-publishing-wave-leaf-categories-comments/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`.

## 0.4.4 - 2026-07-25

Documentation-only release. No code changes — published so the new README
sections reach HexDocs.

### Added
- **README: "How Dispatch Works"** — documents that public routes are served by
  overriding the host router's `call/2` and rewriting `path_info` to an internal
  prefix, with the two consequences that surprise people: a host route whose first
  segment equals a group slug will never match (the rewrite precedes route
  matching, so declaration order in `router.ex` doesn't help; only `GET`/`HEAD` are
  rewritten), and `mix phx.routes` lists these under
  `__phoenix_kit_publishing_dispatch` rather than their public paths.
- **README: "Reserved Route Prefixes"** — documents
  `PhoenixKit.Module.reserved_route_prefixes/0` (`phoenix_kit` >= 1.7.170), how
  `RouterDispatch.known_group?/1` honours it even when a same-named group exists in
  publishing's own data, and the behaviour on older `phoenix_kit`. Includes a
  warning that reserving a prefix without shipping a renderer yields a 404, citing
  the `phoenix_kit_legal` 0.1.6 incident where reserving `"legal"` 404'd public
  legal pages on every host app until it was reverted in 0.1.7.

Both mechanisms previously existed only in source comments and moduledocs, which is
why that regression was diagnosed from a user bug report rather than from docs.

## 0.4.3 - 2026-07-22

PR #36 — sixteen-commit boss-directed batch: a public "Latest" post band,
four band styles (`classic`/`cover`/`cover_panel`/`minimal`/`top`) for both
Featured and Latest, hover-lift listing animations, an admin group-page
header/save overhaul, an admin post-status classification fix, a
per-language URL slug fix for listing links, and group-name AI translation.
Two review rounds ran pre-merge (a 4-agent quality sweep, then a 5-AI
adversarial panel); all confirmed findings were fixed and pinned with tests
before merge — see
`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/36-public-side-batch-and-sweep/FOLLOW_UP.md`
for the full findings/outcomes table. This release re-verified the key
fixes against current code and re-ran the full gate before publishing; no
further changes were needed. Also bumps the `phoenix_kit` dependency pin to
1.7.208.

### Added
- **Latest post band** (`newest_enabled`/`newest_layout` group settings) —
  the chronologically newest post is pulled out of the grid into its own
  "Latest" band under any Featured band; a post that is both featured and
  newest stays in Featured, Latest takes the next-newest. Ties on the same
  effective date break on post UUID for deterministic ordering.
- **Band styles** (`featured_style`/`newest_style`, default `classic`,
  orthogonal to layout): `cover` (featured image as the card background
  under a gradient scrim, branded gradient fallback when no image),
  `cover_panel` (image with an opaque text panel), `minimal` (text-only
  accent-border), `top` (16:9 banner above the text).
- **Listing hover-lift animations** (`listing_animations` group setting,
  default on, motion-safe).
- **Group-name AI translation** — a second AI-translatable adapter
  (`publishing_group`) merges translated names into `data["name_i18n"]`
  under a row lock, with its own `publishing.group.updated` audit trail.
- **Admin group page** — header actions moved into the shared
  `admin_page_header` actions slot with a Settings link to the group
  editor; Save / Save-and-exit split on the group editor.

### Fixed
- **Admin post-status classification** — the admin group page now classifies
  each post by its live (active-version) state, the same rule the public
  listing uses, instead of the latest version's status; a published post
  with a newer draft revision no longer misfiles under Drafts. The visible
  publish date and per-language pills now read the same version-accurate
  data as the status badge.
- **Per-language listing links** — group listing links now use the
  requested language's own custom URL slug instead of the primary
  language's; the language switcher pins the exact-language slug so
  base-code resolution can no longer leak a sibling dialect's slug.
- Public post page: compact name-only back links (`show_top_back_link`,
  top and bottom), an empty toolbar row no longer renders when there are no
  tools, and group-wide `date_counts` now disambiguate timestamp URLs
  correctly on page 2+.

## 0.4.2 - 2026-07-21

PR #34 — public-side listing polish: a "Latest" post band, a top back-link
on post pages, and clickable post-card images, plus a group-wide date-count
fix and card-image a11y guard from the post-merge quorum-review follow-up.
Reviewed post-merge with no further fixes needed — see
`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/34-newest-band-back-link-image-links/` for the
review.

### Added
- **Latest post band** — new `newest_enabled`/`newest_layout` group settings
  pull the chronologically newest post out of the grid into its own "Latest"
  band under any featured posts (`hero` or `card` layout, same vocabulary as
  `featured_layout`). A post that is both featured and newest stays in the
  Featured band; Latest takes the next-newest.
- **Top back link** — new `show_top_back_link` group setting (default on)
  renders a subtle "Back to <group>" link at the top of post pages, mirroring
  the existing footer button, for readers who land mid-archive.
- **Clickable card images** — new `listing_image_links` group setting
  (default on) makes a post card's image click through to the post, same as
  the title; the image link is `aria-hidden`/`tabindex="-1"` since the title
  link is the accessible route to the same destination.

### Fixed
- Group listing `date_counts` (used to decide whether a post's URL needs a
  time segment to disambiguate same-day posts) are now computed over the
  full group, not just the visible page — a page-2 render could previously
  undercount a date shared with a post pinned into the Featured/Latest band
  or sitting on a different page, producing an ambiguous URL.
- `assign_group_display_config/2` no longer flips a stored `false` back to
  a default-`true` setting (was using `||`, which can't represent an
  explicit `false`); affects `show_top_back_link` and any future
  default-on post-display setting.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-07-20

PR #33 — guard the `phoenix_kit_og` refine seam against crashes and document
Phase 2 (the OG-image plugin extension point), plus a post-merge review fix.
See `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/33-og-seam-rescue-and-docs/` for the review.

### Fixed
- `maybe_refine_og_with_module/4` now rescues around the optional
  `phoenix_kit_og` plugin's `refine_og/4` call — a raising plugin previously
  crashed every public post-page render; it now falls back to the per-post
  override/default OG map.
- Removed a stale, unused `mix.lock` entry (`beamlab_ex_aws_sqs`, orphaned by
  an earlier rename to `ex_aws_sqs`) that was failing `mix deps.unlock
  --check-unused` in the release gate.

### Added
- Regression test (`test/phoenix_kit_publishing/web/controller/og_refine_crash_test.exs`)
  covering the crash-guard end-to-end, plus a `PhoenixKitOG` test stub.
- `AGENTS.md` now documents the three-layer OG precedence (derived default →
  per-post override → `phoenix_kit_og` plugin) and how `build_og_data/4`
  resolves it.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-17

PR #32 — public-side publishing: featured posts, timeline/headings scroll
rails, per-group display settings, and a translatable group name. Written
without access to the quality-sweep playbook or a runnable test environment;
this release also folds in a full post-merge multi-AI quorum review (Codex,
Kimi, Grok, ZAI, Vibe) plus a 4-agent playbook triage pass, with every
confirmed finding fixed before publishing. See
`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/32-public-side-display-settings/` for the full
review and fix log.

### Added
- **Featured posts** — an editor checkbox flags a post as featured; the
  public listing renders a hero + secondary featured band ahead of the
  regular grid, each card carrying `data-post-date` (mirrors
  `Listing.listing_sort_key/1`) so the timeline rail stays in sync.
- **Per-group display settings** (`GroupSettings`) — post count visibility
  (off by default), timeline/headings scroll rails, scrollbar styling,
  breadcrumbs, sort order, reading time, card width, date position, and a
  reading-progress bar, all configurable per group with governed string-keyed
  persistence.
- **Translatable group name** (`name_i18n`) — an override per language,
  capped at the primary-name length limit, resolved via
  `translated_group_name/2` everywhere the name surfaces: listing
  h1/title/breadcrumb, `og:title`, the post-page breadcrumb and "Back to …"
  footer, and the all-groups overview cards.
- 33 new tests covering every setting's public-render toggle, settings/
  `name_i18n` persistence (including crash-guard, truncation, invalid-enum,
  atom-key round-trip), and the edit/editor LiveView save paths.

### Fixed (post-merge quorum review)
- `GroupSettings.validate_params/1` normalized atom-keyed settings but kept
  the atom key, so `update_group/3` (string-keyed) silently persisted
  nothing on the documented AI/script path — settings now normalize to their
  canonical string key.
- `merge_name_i18n/2` called `to_string/1` on override values — a nested map
  (crafted params or a programmatic caller) raised `Protocol.UndefinedError`
  and crashed the edit LiveView; non-binary overrides are now dropped
  instead of raising.
- Grid cards preferred `metadata.published_at` over the effective post date
  used for sorting, so the timeline rail could disagree with the visible
  order — both now read a shared `effective_post_date/1` helper.
- The editor's hidden `featured=false` input stayed enabled while its
  checkbox was disabled, so a still-enabled sibling control could clobber
  the flag — now disabled in lockstep (defense-in-depth; pinned by test).
- `name_i18n` overrides bypassed the 255-char primary-name limit.
- `reading_time_label/1` used `gettext` with `%{count}`, which isn't
  pluralizable — switched to `ngettext`.
- Timeline-rail month labels and both rails' aria-labels were hardcoded
  English inside static JS on otherwise fully-localized public pages — now
  localized via `data-months`/`data-label` on the config elements.
- `assign_scroll_config/2` (renamed `assign_group_display_config/2`)
  re-fetched the group a second time per request and redeclared setting
  defaults as literals instead of reading `Constants`.
- Spec-parity and `default_config/0` tests compared against a hardcoded key
  list instead of the real write path (`Groups.config_setting_keys/0`),
  which had gone drift-blind and was missing `show_post_count`.
- Featured vs. grid card markup was near-duplicated in `html.ex` — unified
  into one `listing_post_card/1` component.
- `Groups.update_group/3` and the edit LiveView both broadcast
  `{:group_updated, …}` on save — the LiveView's duplicate removed.
- `translated_group_name/2` was missing a `@spec`.
- 57 admin/public strings per locale were never extracted (written on a
  server without a gettext-capable environment) — all five catalogs
  re-extracted, merged, and translated (en identity, et/fr/it/ru filled).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-04

Publishing's admin/editor UI strings now translate — previously every
`gettext()` call here routed through core's `PhoenixKitWeb.Gettext`, but
`mix gettext.extract` only walks a project's own `lib/`, so none of this
module's ~390 strings were ever extracted into any catalog, in any locale.
The whole admin UI silently rendered in English regardless of locale. Also
picks up the `phoenix_kit_og` `PhoenixKitOg` → `PhoenixKitOG` rename.

### Added
- **Own `PhoenixKitPublishing.Gettext` backend** (`priv/gettext/`), following
  the per-module i18n pattern `phoenix_kit_ecommerce` already uses. All 456
  msgids extracted and translated into English, Russian, Italian, French,
  and Estonian, plurals included with correct per-locale plural-category
  counts (Russian's 3 forms vs. everyone else's 2). Sidebar tab labels
  (`admin_tabs/0`, `settings_tabs/0`) now carry `gettext_backend:`; the
  public-content locale setter syncs both this module's backend and core's,
  so post pages translate too, not just the admin panel.

### Fixed
- Updated the guarded `phoenix_kit_og` integration seam
  (`controller.ex`/`editor.ex`/`.dialyzer_ignore.exs`) for the sibling
  plugin's `PhoenixKitOg` → `PhoenixKitOG` module rename.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-07-03

PRs #27–#29 — a `phoenix_kit_og` integration seam (per-post OG-image template
wiring, editor OG-override panel), a lower SEO-friendly auto-slug cap, a
missing `:url_path` assign that broke canonical URLs on public controller
pages, and route-prefix collisions with other modules' reserved routes. Plus
a post-merge review pass. Built against `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.170`.

### Added
- **`phoenix_kit_og` template-wiring seam** — `Publishing.og_variables/0` +
  `og_resolve/2` expose post title/description/URL/featured image/group
  name/group slug/first-words/published-date for a future OG-image plugin
  to bind to template slots. A per-language OG override
  (title/description/image) is editable from the editor's new "Social /
  OpenGraph" panel and layered into the existing `og:*` meta tags
  (module override → per-post override → derived default). No-op until
  `phoenix_kit_og` is installed.
- `og:image:width` / `og:image:height` / `og:image:type` meta tags when the
  featured (or overridden) image's dimensions are available.

### Changed
- **Auto-generated slug cap lowered 200 → 60 chars** (SEO guidance —
  Ahrefs/Moz/Yoast/Semrush converge on 50–75). Applies only to slugs derived
  from titles / AI translation / transliteration; a human-typed slug is
  still bounded by the 500-char save limit.

### Fixed
- **Public controller pages now assign `:url_path`** so host root layouts
  building canonical/`og:url`/hreflang tags from it don't fall back to `"/"`
  on every publishing-served page (this dropped `/legal/*`-style pages from
  Google's index as canonical duplicates on at least one production site).
- **A group slug that collides with another module's reserved top-level
  route is no longer claimed by the group-dispatch catch-all**, even when a
  same-named group genuinely exists in publishing's own data — closes a hole
  where e.g. a `phoenix_kit_legal`-reserved `"legal"` path could be hijacked
  by publishing's generic post view instead of the owning module's page.
- **Three `og_resolve/2` variables that were silently dead** (`post_url`,
  `post_group_name`, `post_group_slug` always resolved to `nil` — the
  metadata keys they read don't exist on the post map) — found and fixed in
  post-merge review, before anything depended on them.
- `credo --strict` violation in the new OG-image-metadata code
  (unaliased nested module reference).
- `mix dialyzer` was failing outright on this branch (the optional
  `PhoenixKitOg` calls plus two dead-code branches in the new OG-image
  logic). Added `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` for the optional-module warnings
  (matching the pattern already used by sibling `phoenix_kit_*` repos) and
  removed the unreachable branches.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-06-19

Migrates markdown rendering from **Earmark → MDEx (comrak)**. Earmark is retired/unmaintained on Hex, so `mix hex.audit` (part of `precommit`) now reports **no retired packages**. MDEx is already pulled in by `phoenix_kit` core, so this adds no new native footprint. No public API change — `Renderer.render_markdown/1` keeps the same contract; rendered HTML is equivalent (the markdown→HTML output differs only cosmetically: whitespace, `<img />` self-closing, entity normalization).

### Changed
- **`Renderer` now renders markdown with MDEx** (`render: [unsafe: true]`, smart punctuation, GFM tables/strikethrough/autolinks/task lists). The GFM `tagfilter` extension is intentionally left off to preserve the documented admin trust boundary (a pasted `<script>` still renders live).
- **Code-fence handling is simpler and safer.** comrak always HTML-escapes fenced/inline code content, so the plain path no longer pre-escapes; a raw `<script>` inside a ```fence``` still renders as literal text. The mixed (component) path masks only the `<` of components shown literally inside code so the component scanner skips them, then restores it before MDEx (which escapes it) — replacing the old entity pre-escaping that MDEx would double-escape.
- **Render cache version bumped `v4 → v5`** so Earmark-rendered entries are dropped and re-rendered with MDEx instead of served stale.
- Dependency: dropped `{:earmark, "~> 1.4"}`, added `{:mdex, "~> 0.13"}`.

### Fixed
- Test harness no longer crashes when `psql` is absent — it now degrades to "integration tests excluded" so the Level 1 (pure) suite still runs.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-06-18

PR #26 — rewires the post editor onto the core `MarkdownEditor` hook so it renders **zero inline `<script>` and zero `onclick`** (CSP-safe and navigation-safe), plus a post-merge review pass. No public API breaks. Built against `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.162` / `phoenix_kit_ai ~> 0.9` (existing constraints unchanged; the editor-hook and smart-default behaviors light up on those releases and degrade gracefully on older ones).

### Changed
- **Editor media insertion flows through the core `MarkdownEditor`** — images via `:insert_at_cursor` and video via the `:prompt_insert` action — so insertion no longer needs a module-owned inline `<script>` and survives LiveView navigation (image insert previously required a manual page refresh).
- **Unsaved-changes confirmation is a server-rendered modal** instead of a JS `confirm()` (which broke under CSP / on navigation).
- **The AI-translation modal pre-selects the endpoint** from core's smart default (last-used from history, else a non-reasoning chat endpoint) and **auto-closes on a successful translation**, so you no longer re-pick the endpoint or close the modal by hand.
- The auto-generated slug renders straight from the form assign, dropping the dead `update-slug` push and `Forms.push_slug_events/2`.

### Fixed
- **Video toolbar inserts the renderer-supported `<Video url="…">` component** instead of `![Video](url)` markdown, which the renderer turned into a broken `<img>`. Now matches the image-insert path and the `insert_component`/`insert_video_component` handlers.
- Reformatted `editor_forms_test.exs` (stray trailing blank line left by the `push_slug_events/2` test removal).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-11

PR #25 — a full-module adversarial audit: **9 High / 16 Medium / 12 Low** findings fixed across public routing, the listing cache, publishing atomicity, the editor, and markdown rendering, each pinned by a regression test. Plus a post-audit fix to listing-cache invalidation. No public API breaks; the minor bump reflects the breadth of behavioral hardening (redirects, slug-collision precedence, cache/clustering semantics). Built against `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.144`.

### Fixed

**High**
- **301 redirects from renamed posts now fire** — `previous_url_slugs` are actually persisted, so an old URL redirects to the current one instead of 404ing.
- **Router host-route hijack closed** — segment-0 is only treated as a locale when it's an enabled/resolvable language, and a `GET`/`HEAD` method gate stops the publishing router from shadowing a host app's `POST`/form/webhook routes on the same path.
- **Two infinite-redirect loops closed** (canonical-language ping-pong and a future-dated-timestamp fallback loop).
- **Render cache is supervised** — started in the supervision tree instead of being born in a transient request process.
- **Spectator/read-only write guards** on every mutating editor event; editor reloads are pinned to the version being edited.
- **Public version dropdown restored.**

**Medium**
- **Publishing is atomic** and `StaleFixer` heals orphaned published versions — closes the "admin shows published / public 404s" split.
- **Transactional post updates and blank-version creation** (content-wipe + version promotion can no longer half-apply).
- **Timestamp-collision retry** matches by constraint name (won't swallow a slug-uniqueness violation); **trashed timestamp slots** are counted for availability so the retry converges.
- **Cross-group UUID access rejected** — a post UUID from another group returns not-found.
- **Clustering**: cross-node cache invalidation and remote-pid-safe presence checks.
- **Supervised lock table** + crash-proof regeneration guard (a vanished ETS table can't 500 a read).
- **Empty / featured-image-only posts are trashed, not hard-deleted**, with ActivityLog entries.
- **Markdown safety**: code-region integrity, multi-line `<Image>` detection, and consistent HTML escaping across paths.
- **url_slug collisions**: the incumbent post wins and the loser is auto-renamed; claiming another post's previous slug is blocked; the editor shows an explain-and-link conflict modal instead of silently clearing.
- **Admin-insight cache consistency** and **stale translation-lock** clearing.

**Low**
- `switch_version` crash on a junk param; preview save-failure handling; unpublish pre-lock re-read; transactional blank version; timestamp posts stamped in the **site time zone**; group-rename cache invalidation; whole-cache erase on memory-cache disable; double-backtick code spans masked; unresolved `{{placeholder}}` preserved; token-scoped lock release; narrowed update-error rescue; folded the listing-cache timestamps into one term to cut `:persistent_term` churn; title `phx-debounce`; canonical/302 redirects preserve the query string; reserved route words rejected as post/group slugs.

**Post-audit (listing-cache invalidation storm)**
- The `:cache_changed` LiveView handler no longer calls `regenerate/1`, which re-broadcast `:cache_changed` and — because the view subscribes to its own group's cache topic — looped into a self-sustaining, cluster-wide regeneration storm. The handler now **invalidates** the node-local term; the next public read rebuilds it fresh and **silently**. Mutation sites are the only `:cache_changed` announcers; read-miss repopulation is silent. This also removes a stale-hit window and a redundant per-event DB read, and erases stale terms on every node regardless of whether an admin view is mounted.

### Removed
- Dead per-post SEO/OpenGraph override scaffolding, and the `<Hero>` / `<Page>` components (resolved to core modules that were deleted with the Pages module).

### Changed
- Built against `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.144` (`leaf` 0.2.23 transitively); the declared floor stays `~> 1.7.132`.
- `humanize_field/1` keeps acronyms uppercased ("URL slug", "SEO title"); the slug-truncation warning persists while the title stays over the URL cap.

## 0.1.16 - 2026-06-10

PR #24 — editor & public-rendering sweep: stable inline images, legacy image-URL healing at render, automatic in-page OpenGraph, descriptive error flashes, and slug-cap safety. Plus a post-merge crash fix. Built against `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.138` and `phoenix_live_view 1.2`.

### Added
- **Automatic in-page OpenGraph + Twitter Card tags** on public listing + post pages (`publishing_render_og_tags`, default on) so social previews work with zero host `<head>` setup; a Settings toggle disables the in-page copy when the host renders the forwarded `:og` assign itself. The `:og` builder is hardened — relative SEO images normalize to absolute (no more `https://hostimages/...`), and `og:locale` is emitted in OpenGraph's `language_TERRITORY` form.
- **Auto-slug truncation warning** — a non-blocking flash when an automatic slug is shortened to fit the cap (e.g. a long Cyrillic title that transliteration expands, `щ → shch`), transition-gated so live typing past the cap doesn't spam it.

### Changed
- **Inline post images insert as `<Image file_uuid="…"/>` components**, not a frozen signed URL — resolved to a URL at render time, so they survive `url_prefix` changes and `secret_key_base` rotation (the same late resolution the featured image already used). Alt text derives from the file's original name. Drops the client-side `eval()` used for image insertion in favour of a typed `phx:insert-media` event.
- **Editor & admin error flashes are descriptive** — generic catch-alls now route through `Publishing.Errors` (e.g. "Couldn't save this post. Database update failed.") instead of flat "Failed to …" strings, including an `%Ecto.Changeset{}` clause that renders a humanized, capped field summary.
- **The auto-generated slug cap is derived from the save limit** — `min(SEO 200, Constants.max_slug_length)`, so a generated slug provably can't exceed what save accepts.
- Bumped dependencies: `phoenix_kit` 1.7.138, `phoenix_live_view` 1.2, `phoenix_kit_ai` 0.8, `phoenix` 1.8.8, `leaf` 0.2.23. Added `hex.audit` to `mix precommit`.

### Fixed
- **Legacy signed-file image URLs heal at render time** — posts authored before the `<Image>` change stored a fully-resolved `/<old-prefix>/file/…` URL that 404s after a prefix change or secret rotation. The renderer recovers the UUID + variant and re-signs against the current prefix/secret — no data migration, idempotent for current output, external/protocol-relative URLs untouched. The render cache key is now prefix- and secret-aware (bumped to `v3`).
- **`Errors.message/1` no longer crashes the flash** on a changeset whose error opt carries a list value (e.g. an inclusion/subset `enum`): `to_string/1` raises `ArgumentError` there, which is now caught alongside the existing tuple/`Protocol.UndefinedError` case.

## 0.1.15 - 2026-06-08

PR #23 — AI translation moves onto the shared `phoenix_kit_ai` pipeline, version-scoped translation, and editor fixes. Requires `phoenix_kit_ai ~> 0.4`.

### Changed
- **AI translation now runs on the `phoenix_kit_ai` plugin** (bumped to `~> 0.4`). The adapter, translation manager, and editor translation flow are rewired from core's `PhoenixKit.Modules.AI.*` to `PhoenixKitAI.*`. The adapter is duck-typed via `ai_translatables/0` and discovered by `PhoenixKitAI.Translatables`.
- **Translation targets the version the editor is on** (e.g. a draft), not always the active one — `resource_scope` threads through dedup, broadcasts, and `fetch/3` (F1). Default endpoint/prompt resolution is unified (F3), with a regenerate affordance for stale default prompts (F2).
- Standardized on the lowercase `"title"`/`"content"` field convention (matching catalogue/projects).

### Added
- Env-gated `pk_dep/3` path override in `mix.exs`: build/test against a local `phoenix_kit*` checkout via `<APP>_PATH` (e.g. `PHOENIX_KIT_PATH=../phoenix_kit mix test`). Unset = the published pin, so `mix deps.get` / `mix hex.publish` / CI resolve exactly as before.

### Fixed
- **Field-case regression**: capitalized `{{Title}}` placeholders rendered literally and the model hallucinated; now resolved by the lowercase field convention.
- **Duplicate-slug error** names the offending slug and notes uniqueness is within the group, across the create / in-place-update / version paths.
- **AI-translation source warning** distinguishes *nothing* / *only-title* / *only-content* instead of a blanket "source content is empty".
- **Translation modal** gained a reasoning-model hint under the endpoint selector and a clearer "runs in the background, you can keep editing or leave" line (parity with catalogue/projects).

## 0.1.14 - 2026-06-07

PR #21 + PR #22 — editor UX, configurable slug style, and parallel AI translation (one Oban job per language via the shared translation pipeline), plus a post-merge review sweep. Requires `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.132`.

### Added
- **Configurable slug style** (`publishing_slug_style` setting + Settings dropdown). One style-aware `SlugHelpers.slugify/2` that every slug engine routes through: `transliterate` (default — Cyrillic → Latin, `Привет мир` → `privet-mir`), `unicode` (keep letters/numbers from any script, `привет-мир`), and `ascii` (legacy strip). Non-Latin titles no longer collapse to "untitled". Slugs are capped at 200 chars on a hyphen boundary.
- **`PhoenixKitPublishing.AITranslatable`** — adapter onto PhoenixKitAI's generic AI-translation pipeline (`PhoenixKitAI.{Translations,TranslateWorker}`), registered via `ai_translatables/0`. The per-language `url_slug` is generated locally from the translated title (honoring the slug style, never trusting an AI-returned slug) with a group+language uniqueness guard that omits the slug on conflict.
- Editor UX: full-width layout matching the catalogue, aligned header rows, the public URL shown under the action buttons on published posts, and the re-enabled per-language URL Slug field with live preview.

### Changed
- **AI translation now runs one Oban job per target language** (`PhoenixKitAI.Translations.enqueue_all_missing/2`) instead of translating every language sequentially in a single job — wall-clock drops from the sum of all languages to roughly the slowest one. The programmatic `translate_post_to_all_languages/3` routes through the same pipeline.
- `ai_translation_available?/0`, `list_ai_endpoints/0`, and `list_ai_prompts/0` delegate to `PhoenixKitAI.Translations` instead of re-deriving the `{uuid, name}` shape a third time (PR #21). Publishing keeps its own default endpoint/prompt resolution and its `translate-publishing-posts` prompt.
- The `url_slug` uniqueness check now excludes the current post **in SQL**.
- Added/updated the `phoenix_kit_ai` dependency for the generic AI-translation pipeline this module plugs into.

### Fixed
- **Translation source is always the primary language**, never the language the editor happens to be viewing — "translate this language" on a non-primary page no longer enqueues a language into itself, and "translate all/missing" no longer sources from a translation. Covers the `source_content_blank?/1` blank-source confirmation warning.
- **Read/write version pinning** in the translation adapter — a published-v1 + draft-v2 post no longer reads one version and writes the new language row onto another.
- The `url_slug` input gained `maxlength="200"` and a style-aware HTML5 `pattern`, so a valid Unicode slug isn't rejected client-side under the `unicode` style.
- The in-flight translation query references the core worker module instead of a hardcoded string, and a dead `|| %{}` guard on the always-a-map `post.metadata` was removed (Dialyzer).

### Removed
- The legacy `Workers.TranslatePostWorker` and its tests — superseded by the `AITranslatable` adapter + PhoenixKitAI pipeline (net −1.3k LOC).

## 0.1.13 - 2026-05-22

PR #20 — restore a defensive non-binary fallback in `TranslatePostWorker.parse_translated_response/1`, plus a follow-up that tightens the log-safe type descriptor.

### Fixed
- `TranslatePostWorker.parse_translated_response/1` no longer raises `FunctionClauseError` on non-binary input. After PR #19 delegated parsing to core's `Translation.parse_response/2` (guarded by `is_binary/1`), the `def`-public function could crash when handed `nil` / atom / number / map by a test or external caller — and `AI.extract_content/1` can itself surface `{:ok, nil}` when a provider returns a null `content`. A guarded `when is_binary(response)` clause now owns the parse path; a catch-all clause fails closed with the empty-tuple shape `{"", nil, ""}` and emits a `Logger.warning` so a production occurrence (which would persist a blank translation row) is operator-visible.
- The `describe_type/1` log helper reports only a value's type/shape — never its contents — to avoid leaking PII / API keys from pathological inputs, and uses a `proper_list?/1` guard so it doesn't itself crash on improper lists (`length/1` raises `ArgumentError` on `[:a | :b]`).

### Changed
- `describe_type/1` now uses a literal `nil` head instead of an `is_nil/1` guard, and gained an `is_bitstring/1` clause so a non-byte-aligned bitstring (e.g. `<<1::3>>`, which is not an `is_binary/1` match) logs as `bitstring` rather than `unknown`.
- Locked transitive dependencies: `etcher 0.4.8`, `fresco 0.5.5`, `ex_doc 0.40.3`.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-05-21

PR #19 — unify the translation-response parser with core (paired with `phoenix_kit 1.7.117`).

### Changed
- `TranslatePostWorker.parse_translated_response/1` now delegates to the shared `Translation.parse_response/2` helper (the canonical `---FIELD---` parser shared with `phoenix_kit_projects`) instead of a hand-rolled chained-regex matcher. It tries `["title", "slug", "content"]` first, retries with `["title", "content"]` on missing fields, and falls back to the publishing-specific `parse_markdown_response/1` salvage when no markers are present. The AI call sites, `extract_content/1`, and `sanitize_slug/1` are untouched.
- Bumped the `phoenix_kit` dependency floor to `~> 1.7.117`, which is where the shared translation parser became available; the lock also picks up `etcher 0.4.6`, `fresco 0.5.4`, and `req 0.5.18`.

### Fixed
- Translation responses with `---FIELD---` markers in any order, or with lower/mixed-case marker names, now parse correctly instead of falling through to the bare-markdown salvage path. Covered by new regression tests for marker order-independence, case-insensitive markers, and the TITLE-only fallback.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-05-19

PR #18 — delegate the `default_language_no_prefix` toggle to the site-wide core setting (paired with `phoenix_kit 1.7.115`).

### Changed
- `LanguageHelpers.default_language_no_prefix?/0` now delegates to `PhoenixKit.Modules.Languages.default_language_no_prefix?/0` instead of reading the legacy `publishing_default_language_no_prefix` setting key directly. All consumers (the six `Web.HTML` URL builders, the canonical-redirect controller, and the `Publishing.default_language_no_prefix?/0` / `use_language_prefix?/1` facade) keep the same signature and behavior.
- `/admin/settings/publishing` — the "Default Language Without Prefix" toggle is replaced with a read-only status row and a "Manage" link to `/admin/settings/languages`, which now owns the setting. Removes the dual-write risk where the publishing-side write could desync from the core-side read mid-deploy.
- Bumped `phoenix_kit` to `1.7.115`, which ships `Modules.Languages.default_language_no_prefix?/0` and the `Languages.migrate_legacy/0` backfill (run by `ModuleRegistry` at boot) that copies the legacy `publishing_default_language_no_prefix` value into the new core key, so existing sites keep their explicit choice without admin action.

### Removed
- `@default_language_no_prefix_key` constant and the `toggle_default_language_no_prefix` LiveView event on `Web.Settings` — the setting is no longer publishing-owned.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-05-19

Maintenance release — LiveView callback annotations and dependency bumps.

### Changed
- Added `@impl true` annotations to the `Web.Settings` LiveView callbacks (`mount/3`, `handle_params/3`, `terminate/2`, `handle_event/3`, `handle_info/2`, `render/1`) so the compiler verifies them against the `Phoenix.LiveView` behaviour.
- Bumped dependencies: `ecto` `3.13.6` → `3.14.0`, `ecto_sql` `3.13.5` → `3.14.0`, `fresco` `0.5.0` → `0.5.2`.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-05-19

PR #16 — Phase 2 quality sweep (URL-slug correctness, DoS guards, race fixes, archive semantics, host boundaries) + post-merge review fixes + the `phoenix_kit 1.7.114` upgrade.

### Fixed
- **`Ecto.MultipleResultsError` on URL-slug post lookups.** Posts that accumulated several versions sharing identical content fields crashed `repo().one()`. URL-slug resolution is now scoped to the post's active version (public path) with a deterministic tie-break.
- **Two DoS vectors closed.** (1) The PHK page-builder XML parser used `String.to_atom/1` on admin-supplied tag names — arbitrary tags could exhaust the finite BEAM atom table and crash the VM. It now uses `String.to_existing_atom/1`, routing unknown tags to `:unknown`. (2) `ListingCache` minted a never-GC'd `:persistent_term` entry for every unknown URL segment treated as a group slug; it now verifies the group exists before writing (each write also triggers a global GC pass — a flood of bad requests was a DoS on top of the leak).
- **Language-switch redirect loop on a trailing `?`.** `build_public_path/2` encoded an empty query map to `"foo?"`, which never equals the canonical `"foo"`, so the 301 looped to itself. Empty params now produce no `?`.
- **Public URLs broke under a non-root workspace prefix.** `RouterDispatch` gained `maybe_rewrite/2`, which strips/re-prepends the host's `url_prefix` so dispatch works when PhoenixKit is mounted under e.g. `/phoenix_kit`.
- **Publish/unpublish races.** Both `do_publish_version/4` and `do_unpublish_post/3` now take a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` lock on the post row (shared `lock_post!/2` helper) so concurrent publishes/unpublishes can't interleave into a stale `active_version_uuid`. Timestamp-mode `create_post` retries the whole transaction on a `(group_uuid, post_date, post_time)` unique-constraint violation instead of failing.
- **`find_by_previous_url_slug/3` surfaced unpublished posts** — a public 301 redirect could resolve onto a never-published post that then 404s. Now scoped to the active version only.
- **`clear_translation` editor event was unguarded** — a spectator/locked-out viewer could hard-delete a translation row by sending the event directly over the socket. Now gated like every other destructive editor event.

### Added
- **`find_by_url_slug_any_version/3`** (`Posts` / `DBStorage`) — internal lookup that surfaces unpublished drafts, for the stale-language self-healing flow and slug-uniqueness checks. The public `find_by_url_slug/3` stays published-only.
- **`unpublish_post` `:target_status` option** — the "Archived" UI action now persists `status: "archived"` on the version row instead of silently reverting to `"draft"`.
- `terminate/2` on the `Index`, `PostShow`, and `Settings` LiveViews for subscribe/unsubscribe symmetry.
- i18n sweep — previously-hardcoded UI strings on the public listing/post pages and editor now flow through `gettext`/`ngettext`.

### Changed
- **URL-slug lookup split** into a public, published-only path and an internal any-version path; collisions on the public path self-heal by auto-suffixing the loser's `url_slug`.
- **base→dialect resolution consolidated** — three near-identical helpers in `Posts`, `Web.Controller.Language`, and `StaleFixer` collapse into `LanguageHelpers.resolve_dialect_for_base/3` with explicit `:prefer` / `:exclude` options.
- The admin "Edit Post" link now carries the current public-side language via `?lang=` so the editor opens in the language the reader was viewing.
- Narrowed `rescue` clauses in `Publishing.dashboard_tabs`, `load_publishing_groups_for_tabs`, and `Web.Preview` to catch only expected DB/render exceptions — genuine programmer errors bubble up again instead of being masked.
- `clear_translation/4` writes an `ActivityLog` audit entry, matching `delete_language`.
- Bumped `phoenix_kit` to `~> 1.7.114`, which adds the generic `:module_assigns` attr on `LayoutWrapper.app_layout/1`; `Web.HTML` forwards `phoenix_kit_publishing_translations` and `og` to the host layout through it.
- `create_post_with_timestamp_retry` takes a single context map instead of nine positional arguments.

### Docs
- `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/16-phase-2-quality-sweep/` — `CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` (post-merge review) and `FOLLOW_UP.md` (findings triage + `mix precommit` restoration after the upgrade).

## 0.1.8 - 2026-05-09

PR #15 — host-integration hooks for the language switcher + post-merge boundary normalisation.

### Added
- **`:phoenix_kit_publishing_translations` conn assign** — the public API contract for host-app switchers. Set on listing and post responses (regardless of the in-page-switcher toggle) as a list of maps with exactly five fields: `%{code, name, flag, url, current}`. Lets host root layouts and custom switchers render publishing's per-translation URLs directly — important for groups with per-language URL slugs where a generic locale-rewrite produces wrong hrefs.
- **`publishing_show_language_switcher` setting** (default `true`) — gates the in-page switcher on listing + post pages. Hosts that already render a switcher in their header flip it to `false` in `/admin/settings/publishing` to suppress duplicate UI. Per-translation URLs stay exposed regardless.
- Settings UI gains an "In-Page Language Switcher" toggle mirroring the existing `publishing_default_language_no_prefix` shape.

### Changed
- `Web.Controller.assign_publishing_translations/2` normalises the public assign at the boundary, stripping internal-only fields (`display_code`, and on post routes `enabled`/`known`) so external consumers get a uniform 5-field shape on both listing and post routes. Internal `:translations` assign is unchanged.
- `Web.HTML` listing and post templates gate the in-page switcher on `assigns[:show_language_switcher] != false` — defaults to rendering when the assign is absent, preserving historical behaviour for hosts that haven't threaded the assign through.
- Bumped transitive deps in `mix.lock`: db_connection 2.10.0 → 2.10.1, decimal 2.3.0 → 3.1.0, ex_doc 0.40.1 → 0.40.2, leaf 0.2.12 → 0.2.13, makeup_erlang 1.0.3 → 1.1.0, mint 1.7.1 → 1.8.0.

### Docs
- AGENTS.md gains a "Language switcher integration" section documenting the three integration points (the toggle, the conn assign, and core's matching `<.language_switcher_dropdown>` `:per_translation_urls` attr) + a row in the Settings Keys table.
- `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/15-language-switcher-host-integration/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` — post-merge review.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-05-05

PR #13 — fix issue #11 (editor opens blank for `?lang=<base>` when only a non-default dialect is enabled) + PR-12 close-out + precommit nits.

### Fixed
- **Editor opened blank when `?lang=<base>` mapped to a non-default dialect (Issue #11).** Two-layer bug: `Posts.resolve_language_to_dialect/1` mapped `"en"` to the hard-coded `DialectMapper` default (`"en-US"`) instead of an enabled dialect like `"en-GB"`, and `Editor.handle_uuid_post_params/3` then ran a raw `language not in post.available_languages` check which routed `"en"` against `["en-GB", "ru"]` into `handle_new_translation_params/6` (empties the form). Fix at both layers — neither alone is sufficient.
- `post_rendering_helpers_test.exs:74` — stale `build_breadcrumbs/3` call site missed by the `7f547b5` (PR #12 cleanup) arity bump to `/4`. Now passes the `group_name` arg explicitly and asserts on the resulting label.

### Changed
- `Posts.resolve_language_to_dialect/1` — prefers an enabled dialect for the given base before falling back to `DialectMapper.base_to_dialect/1`. When several dialects share the base, prefers `LanguageHelpers.get_primary_language/0`, otherwise the first enabled dialect in declaration order. New private helper `enabled_dialect_for_base/2`.
- `Editor.handle_uuid_post_params/3` and `Editor.handle_path_post_params/3` — route through new `new_translation_request?/2` helper that resolves the requested language against `post.available_languages` via `Web.Controller.Language.resolve_language_for_post/2` before deciding new-vs-existing translation.
- `test_helper.exs` — swapped `Ecto.Migrator.run(TestRepo, [{0, PhoenixKit.Migration}], :up, ...)` for `PhoenixKit.Migration.ensure_current(TestRepo, log: false)` (core 1.7.105+ / phoenix_kit#515). The version-`0` pattern silently stopped re-applying once `0` was recorded in `schema_migrations`; `ensure_current/2` re-applies via fresh wall-clock versions on every boot.
- `StaleFixerTest` switched from `async: true` → `async: false`. Every test in the file mutates the shared `content_language` setting (ETS-cached singleton); two parallel runs in the same VM clobbered each other and produced a 1-in-15 flake on `:96 url slug lookup repairs legacy base-language slugs`.
- Bumped to `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.105` (required by `Migration.ensure_current/2`) and `phoenix_kit_ai ~> 0.2.0`. The latter tightened return types of `AI.list_endpoints/1` and `AI.list_prompts/1`; `Editor.Translation.list_ai_endpoints/0` and `list_ai_prompts/0` dropped now-dead `_ -> []` fallbacks.

### Docs
- AGENTS.md gains a "Base→enabled-dialect resolution" Critical Conventions bullet documenting the resolver behavior, the editor-side contract, and the issue #11 reference.
- `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/12-smart-fallback-fix/FOLLOW_UP.md` records resolution of the four `CLAUDE_REVIEW.md` findings from PR #12 (3 fixed in `7f547b5`, 1 here) and closes the folder.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-05-02

PR #12 — fix smart-fallback URL hijack + drop hand-rolled migrations + Phase 2 cleanup.

### Fixed
- **Smart-fallback URL hijacking** — when `url_prefix` is `""`/`"/"`, publishing's catch-all sits at the host's absolute root. Unknown first segments now 404 instead of silently redirecting to the first group in the DB (which hijacked host-app paths like `/about`, `/contact`).
- `conn.params` rewrite after `Language.detect_*` reinterpretation — downstream code (including the fallback) now sees corrected `group`/`path` instead of the raw (wrong) bindings from the localized route.

### Removed
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.Migrations.PublishingTables` — 311-line consolidated migration was dead code; every consumer pulls in `phoenix_kit` core whose V59 creates the same tables. Use `mix phoenix_kit.install` (has been the correct path since extraction).
- `constraints: %{...}` maps on public routes — Phoenix.Router has no per-segment regex constraint mechanism; these were always no-ops. Route declaration order + controller-layer disambiguation are the actual mechanisms.
- `created_by_email`/`updated_by_email` from `Shared.audit_metadata/2` — the publishing schema has no email columns; these keys were silently stripped by mass-assignment guard (dead plumbing from core's pre-extraction blogging module).

### Changed
- Test suite uses `Ecto.Migrator.run(TestRepo, [{0, PhoenixKit.Migration}], :up, ...)` instead of 178 lines of inline DDL — test/prod schema drift is now impossible by construction.
- `Listing.default_group_listing/1` removed — no longer a meaningful concept after the fallback-policy fix.
- `build_breadcrumbs/3` → `/4` — accepts `group_name` directly, eliminating a redundant group lookup per public page render. `render_published_post` and `build_versioned_post_response` now include `group_name` in their assigns maps; the controller consumes it instead of calling `Publishing.group_name/1` separately.
- `String.capitalize(@group_slug)` in `html.ex` and `preview.ex` replaced with `@group_name` assign — slugs like `"date12"` no longer render as `"Date12"` in the "Back to" link.

### Docs
- AGENTS.md and README.md updated: removed `migrations/` from lib-tree, documented smart-fallback semantics, noted that `constraints:` on public routes is a no-op.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-04-28

PR #10 — quality sweep + 4 coverage-push batches (33.34% → 63.79% line coverage).

### Added
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.Errors` — central atom-to-gettext mapping (36 atoms + 4 tagged-tuple shapes) plus `truncate_for_log/2` to cap unbounded log payloads (AI responses, HTTP errors).
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.ActivityLog.log_failed_mutation/5` — writes a `db_pending: true` audit row when a user-driven mutation fails, so the audit trail still captures intent on DB constraint failures.
- Activity logging on every Posts / Groups / Versions / TranslationManager mutation (success and failure paths).
- `phx-disable-with` on every async / destructive admin button.

### Changed
- **PubSub payload contract** — `broadcast_post_created/2`, `broadcast_post_updated/2`, `broadcast_post_status_changed/2`, and `broadcast_version_created/2` now emit a minimal `%{uuid:, slug:}` payload instead of the full post map. Receivers should refetch the post via `Publishing.read_post/4` (or any of the read helpers) rather than destructuring the broadcast. Internal consumers were already doing this; **host apps that subscribe to `PubSub.posts_topic/1` must update their pattern matches.**
- `DBStorage.upsert_group/1` rewritten as atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` — closes a TOCTOU race where two concurrent callers with the same slug could both observe `nil` and then crash on the unique index.
- `Web.Settings.mount/3` moved DB reads into `handle_params/3` (Phoenix iron law: `mount/3` runs twice per page load).
- `StaleFixer.apply_stale_fix/3` retries once on `(group_uuid, slug)` unique-index conflict using a deterministic `post_uuid[0..8]` suffix.
- `StaleFixer.fix_all_stale_values/0` now streams posts under `Repo.checkout/1` so large catalogues don't hold every post in memory.
- Posts save path: `maybe_sync_datetime_and_audit/3` consolidates timestamp-mode date sync + audit field updates into a single `update_post/2` (halves round-trips per save).
- Three `rescue _` clauses narrowed to `UndefinedFunctionError | ArgumentError`: `LanguageHelpers.reserved_language_code?/1`, `LanguageHelpers.single_language_mode?/0`, `Web.Controller.Language.valid_language?/1`.
- `Web.Controller.Translations.language_enabled_for_public?/2` renamed to `exact_enabled_for_public?/2` to distinguish from `LanguageHelpers.language_enabled?/2` (the looser variant).
- `Workers.TranslatePostWorker.translate_content/4` → `/3` and `skip_already_translated/5` → `/4` — dropped unused `group_slug` parameter (internal callers only).

### Fixed
- `Errors.truncate_for_log/2` UTF-8 boundary handling — multibyte input could previously return an invalid binary if `max` landed mid-codepoint; clip now walks back to the previous codepoint boundary.

### Docs
- Earmark `escape: false` trust model documented inline in `renderer.ex` (admin-authored Markdown only; rewire `html_sanitize_ex` if untrusted input ever reaches `render_markdown/1`).

## 0.1.4 - 2026-04-24

PR #9 — closes issues #6, #7, #8 plus related content-normalization and admin URL consistency work.

### Added
- `publishing_default_language_no_prefix` setting (Issue #7) — opt-in URL convention where the default language is served prefixless (`/blog` instead of `/en/blog`); prefixed URLs 301-redirect to the canonical. `Language.request_matches_canonical_url?/2` prevents redirect loops.
- `LanguageHelpers.get_primary_language_base/0`, `url_language_code/1`, `use_language_prefix?/1` — normalize dialect codes (`"en-GB"`) to URL base codes (`"en"`) for public routing. (Issue #6)
- `StaleFixer.normalize_content_language/1` — self-healing for legacy base-only content rows (`"en"`) when a dialect (`"en-GB"`) becomes the default. Paired with `TranslationManager` legacy-base promotion and `Posts.read_post` lazy retry-on-miss.
- Activity-log events for self-healing mutations: `publishing.content.language_normalized`, `.merged`, `.promoted`.
- `PhoenixKit.Modules.Publishing.ActivityLog` wrapper — guarded with `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` + `try/rescue` so audit failures never crash the primary mutation.
- Controller test-endpoint infrastructure (`Test.Endpoint`, `Test.Router`, `Test.Layouts`, `PhoenixKitPublishing.ConnCase`).

### Changed
- Public URL builders (`group_listing_path/3`, `build_post_url/4`, `build_public_path_with_time/4`) normalize dialect codes via `url_language_code/1`.
- Admin preview URLs (`Web.Index`, `Web.Listing`, `Web.New`) now route through `PublishingHTML` builders instead of hand-rolling prefix logic. (Follow-up to #6)
- Public language switcher deduplicates base + dialect entries and highlights the active language exactly.

### Fixed
- Forward `phoenix_kit_current_scope` from `Web.HTML.all_groups/1` and `Web.HTML.index/1` into `LayoutWrapper.app_layout` so the parent app header sees authenticated users on public Publishing pages. (Issue #8)
- Translation bug in cache-toggle flashes.
- Dialyzer warning on a statically-true `is_binary/1` guard introduced in PR #3.

### Docs
- `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` updated with the new setting, scope-forwarding convention for public templates, controller-test infrastructure pointer, and activity-log event table.
