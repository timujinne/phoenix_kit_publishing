  @moduledoc """
  Guards the `:phoenix_kit` requirement against being re-narrowed to a single
  core MINOR, and against a local path override reaching a commit.

  The trap is the three-segment form: `~> 2.4.x` expands to
  `>= 2.4.x and < 2.5.0`, so no 2.5 or later core satisfies it. The breakage
  lands on CONSUMERS, never here — a host depending on both this module and a
  newer core minor gets an unsolvable dependency set and `mix deps.get` fails
  outright, with no degraded mode. Nothing else in this repo's own test run
  would notice, which is why the check is a test rather than a convention.

  What this does NOT forbid is raising the FLOOR. `>= 2.38.0 and < 3.0.0`
  still admits every later 2.x, and the floor has to track the oldest core
  that has every function this module calls, BEHAVING as this module needs it
  to. The earlier floors' reasons, all subsumed now:

    * `PublishingGroup.changeset/2` calls `PhoenixKit.Utils.Slug.put_slug/3`,
      added in core 2.4.0 — the original floor, and the loud kind of gap: a
      floor left at 2.0 lets `mix deps.get` resolve a core without the
      function and moves the failure to an `UndefinedFunctionError` on the
      host's first group create.
    * `Constants.to_site_wall/2` and `from_site_wall/3` reach
      `Utils.Date.shift_to_offset/2` and `parse_datetime_local/2`, which only
      became IANA-aware in core 2.13.9 — the SILENT kind. Both functions exist
      on an older core and both compile; they just read `Europe/Tallinn` as
      offset `0`, so every timestamp post is stamped, released and syndicated
      on UTC with no error anywhere. A present-but-wrong function is why this
      floor is about behaviour, not just arity.
    * The group media folders (`MediaFolders`, `MediaAdoption`,
      `MediaReorganizer`) are built on `Storage.ResourceFolders` and the
      reorganizer's `ResourceSource`, both first shipped in core 2.38.0 — the
      current floor.

  The floor is 2.38.0 now: the category parent pickers are core's
  `TreePicker`, the actor and activity log come from `PhoenixKitWeb.Actor` and
  `Activity.log/3`, and the edit forms use `mount_multilang(open_on:)` — an
  older core does not compile the package. Raise this alongside `mix.exs`
  whenever a newly-adopted core API — or a newly-relied-on core BEHAVIOUR —
  sets a higher one, keeping the compound form: patch-precise at the bottom,
  open through every later 2.x minor at the top.

  Core 1.7 is deliberately excluded: core 2.0.0 squashed the migration chain to
  a V135 floor and this module is verified only against that baseline.

  # to run this suite against unreleased core. Reading the committed literal from
  # mix.exs as a fallback keeps the check meaningful under that override instead
