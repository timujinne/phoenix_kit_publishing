defmodule PhoenixKitPublishing.CorePinConformanceTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  @moduledoc """
  Guards the `:phoenix_kit` requirement against being re-narrowed to a single
  core MINOR, and against a local path override reaching a commit.

  The trap is the three-segment form: `~> 2.4.x` expands to
  `>= 2.4.x and < 2.5.0`, so no 2.5 or later core satisfies it. The breakage
  lands on CONSUMERS, never here — a host depending on both this module and a
  newer core minor gets an unsolvable dependency set and `mix deps.get` fails
  outright, with no degraded mode. Nothing else in this repo's own test run
  would notice, which is why the check is a test rather than a convention.

  What this does NOT forbid is raising the two-segment FLOOR. `~> 2.38` still
  admits every later 2.x, and the floor has to track the oldest core that has
  every function this module calls, BEHAVING as this module needs it to:

    * `PublishingGroup.changeset/2` calls `PhoenixKit.Utils.Slug.put_slug/3`,
      added in core 2.4.0 — the original floor, and the loud kind of gap: a
      floor left at 2.0 lets `mix deps.get` resolve a core without the
      function and moves the failure to an `UndefinedFunctionError` on the
      host's first group create.
    * `Constants.to_site_wall/2` and `from_site_wall/3` reach
      `Utils.Date.shift_to_offset/2` and `parse_datetime_local/2`, which only
      became IANA-aware in core 2.13.9 — the SILENT kind. Both functions exist
      on an older core and both compile; they just read `Europe/Tallinn` as
      offset `0`, so every timestamp post is stamped, released and syndicated
      on UTC with no error anywhere. A present-but-wrong function is why this
      floor is about behaviour, not just arity.
    * The group media folders (`MediaFolders`, `MediaAdoption`,
      `MediaReorganizer`) are built on `Storage.ResourceFolders` and the
      reorganizer's `ResourceSource`, both first shipped in core 2.38.0 — the
      current floor.

  Raise this alongside `mix.exs` whenever a newly-adopted core API — or a
  newly-relied-on core BEHAVIOUR — sets a higher one.

  Core 1.7 is deliberately excluded: core 2.0.0 squashed the migration chain to
  a V135 floor and this module is verified only against that baseline.
